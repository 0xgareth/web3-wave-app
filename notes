HRE - hardhat runtime environment
    object containing functionality exposed when running tasks/tests/scripts
        hardhat is really the HRE
    before running task/test/script hardhat injects HRE into global scope making its fields global vars
    you can extend the HRE to expose pacakges/libraries within the HRE object at runtime
        done by adding to hardhat config
